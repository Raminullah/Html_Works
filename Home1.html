    The Afghanistan men's national cricket team <q>(Pashto: د افغانستان کرکټ ملي لوب‌‌‌‌‌‌ډله, Persian: تیم ملی کریکت افغانستان)</q>
    represents Afghanistan in men's international cricket. It is a full Member of the International Cricket Council (ICC) with Test,
    One-Day International (ODI) and <q>T20</q> International (T20I) status.[14]

    Cricket has been played in Afghanistan since the<bdo>mid-19th century,</bdo> 
    but it was only in the early 21st century that the national team began to enjoy success.
    The Afghanistan Cricket Board was formed in 1995,
    becoming an affiliate member of the International Cricket Council <abbr>(ICC) in 2001[15]</abbr>
    and a member of the cricket confederation, Asian Cricket Council (ACC) in 2003.[16]
    After nearly a decade of playing international cricket, on 22 June 2017 full ICC membership (and therefore Test status)
    was granted to Afghanistan. Alongside Ireland, this took the number of Test cricket playing nations to twelve.
